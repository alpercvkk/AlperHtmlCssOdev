                        </h1>

                        The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is – obviously – a document about human
                        rights. So why
                        is dignity listed before rights in Article 1?

                        Dignity is the foundation of all human rights. Human beings have rights, and should be treated
                        with utmost
                        care, precisely because each one possesses intrinsic worth. Former UN rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al
                        Hussein
                        called these opening words “perhaps the most resonant and beautiful words of any international
                        agreement.”
                        They underline that “human rights are not a reward for good behavior,” as he put it, but the
                        entitlement of
                        all people at all times and in all places.

                        Reacting to the horror of the two World Wars, the international community thought it important
                        in 1948 to
                        emphasize the concept of human dignity in the very first words of this groundbreaking document,

                        </h1>

                        Article 2 states that everyone is entitled to all the freedoms listed in the UDHR, “without
                        distinction of
                        any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
                        social
                        origin, property, birth or other status.” The last words of this sentence – “other status” –
                        have frequently
                        been cited to expand the list of people specifically protected.

                        This language is reflected in regional instruments, such as the African Charter on Human and
                        Peoples'
                        Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention for the Protection
                        of Human
                        Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The UN has elaborated rights in a number of treaties that build
                        on Article
                        2 – including most recently the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was
                        adopted in
                        2006. It is also key to current efforts to protect all groups that face persecution, even those
                        not
                        specifically covered by a particular international Convention.

                        <h1>Article 3: Right to Life</h1>

                        The first six words of this short article are at the heart of global attempts to end the death
                        penalty. If
                        it enshrines the right to life, abolitionists argue, how can state-sponsored killing be
                        justified? As South
                        African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu said, “to take a life when a life has been lost is revenge,
                        not
                        justice.”

                        Drafters of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) had fresh in their minds Nazi
                        concentration camps and state-organized slaughter of millions simply because they were not the
                        “correct”
                        sort of person. Article 3 – and closely related Articles 5 and 9 against torture and arbitrary
                        arrest – were
                        a firm renunciation of Hitler’s belief in the supremacy of the state to control the lives of
                        individuals.

                        <h1>Article 4: Freedom from Slavery</h1>

                        Men bought and sold like commodities, held for years against their will on fishing boats off
                        Thailand.
                        Yazidi women sold into sex slavery, raped daily and passed from owner to owner. Human beings
                        offered as
                        birthday gifts to children.

                        Article 4 is clear: no one has the right to make us a slave and we cannot make anyone our slave.
                        But if you
                        thought slavery disappeared with the end of the Transatlantic slave trade in the 1800s, it may
                        be a shock to
                        learn of the abuse of fisherfolk who supply seafood to some of the world’s top supermarkets, the
                        fate of
                        women under so-called Islamic State or of migrant women in brothels in Europe and elsewhere; or
                        current
                        reality in Mauritania, the last country in the world to officially ban slavery.

                        Enormous progress has been made in the 70 years since adoption of the Universal Declaration of
                        Human Rights
                        (UDHR) and indeed in the 150 years since entire economies were based on ownership of our fellow
                        human
                        beings, and religious leaders found divine inspiration for the oppressive system. Yet,
                        slavery-like
                        practices and trafficking in human beings continue to remain a reality of our time.

                        <h1>Article 5: Freedom from Torture</h1>

                        There is one absolute prohibition in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that is
                        universally
                        accepted as unequivocal: Article 5’s ban on torture. At times, states may have disputed the
                        definition of
                        what constitutes torture, but virtually none now openly defend the practice, even if some still
                        carry it out
                        in what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described as “some of the darkest corners of
                        our planet.”

                        The ban on torture is another reflection of the revulsion against Nazi concentration camps and
                        Nazi medical
                        experiments on living people that so motivated the drafters of the UDHR in the late 1940s. It is
                        further
                        elaborated in the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture, which makes the absolute nature of the
                        prohibition of
                        torture crystal clear: “No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a
                        threat of war,
                        internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as justification of
                        torture.”

            <h1>Article 1: We are all born free and equal</h1>

            The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is – obviously – a document about human rights. So why
            is dignity listed before rights in Article 1?

            Dignity is the foundation of all human rights. Human beings have rights, and should be treated with utmost
            care, precisely because each one possesses intrinsic worth. Former UN rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein
            called these opening words “perhaps the most resonant and beautiful words of any international agreement.”
            They underline that “human rights are not a reward for good behavior,” as he put it, but the entitlement of
            all people at all times and in all places.

            Reacting to the horror of the two World Wars, the international community thought it important in 1948 to
            emphasize the concept of human dignity in the very first words of this groundbreaking document, underlining
            a term that was already highlighted in the opening line of the UDHR’s Preamble, as well as in the Charter
            that founded the United Nations three years earlier.

            Mary Robinson, another former human rights chief, regards dignity as “an inner sense of self-worth,” a
            concept that “evokes an empathy with the other, connects us one to the other.” It has also provided the
            springboard for new interpretations of human rights. As Robinson said, “in our inter-connected world, that
            empathy must expand to tackling the gross inequalities that raise issues of justice.”

            Dignity (a word that appears five times in the Declaration) is on the one hand an irrefutable argument, and
            on the other an ambiguous concept, not always easily translated into legislation. Even so,dignity now is
            recognized as a right in more than 160 of the world’s constitutions (of 193 UN members), compared to only
            five countries that used the term in their constitutions in 1945.

            And it often falls to judges to make sure human dignity is respected. Judges like Albie Sachs, who devoted
            his life to ensuring, and then protecting, human dignity. As a South African anti-apartheid campaigner, he
            spent months in solitary confinement and lost an arm and his sight in one eye when his car was blown up by
            security agents.

            Later, he sat for 15 years as a judge in South Africa's highest court. He has written that he found himself
            in tears after ruling that South African Airways could not discriminate against an air steward with HIV.
            “The tears had come because of an overwhelming sense of pride at being a member of a court that protected
            fundamental rights and secured dignity for all,” he said.

            Securing dignity for all is at the heart of a UN campaign that draws on the preceding words in Article 1.
            “Free and Equal” is the slogan for the UN’s campaign against homophobia and transphobia that began in 2013
            and aims “tobuild a world where no one has to be afraid because of their sexual orientation or gender
            identity,” in the words of UN Secretary-General António Guterres

            Gender is a concept that is – possibly subtly – addressed in Article 1, and indeed in almost every clause of
            the UDHR. For its time, the document is remarkably lacking in sexist language. Aside from the single phrase
            “himself and his family,” which appears in Articles 23 and 25, the document refers throughout to “everyone,”
            “all” or “no one.”

            This trailblazing usage reflects the fact that women played a prominent role in drafting the UDHR, for the
            first time in the history of international law-making. The process was steered by Eleanor Roosevelt, the
            former U.S. First Lady and an outspoken champion of human rights. Women from Denmark, Pakistan, the
            Communist bloc and other non-western nations also made crucial contributions.

            Article 1’s first words echo France’s seminal Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen, (Declaration
            of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen), adopted soon after the French Revolution in 1789. Thanks to the
            tenacious Indian drafter Hansa Mehta, the French phrase “all men are born free and equal” became “all human
            beings are born free and equal.”

            She objected to Roosevelt’s assertion that “men” was understood to include women – a widely-accepted concept
            at the time. Mehta argued that countries could use this wording to restrict the rights of women, rather than
            expand them.

            The UDHR’s women drafters provided an enduring legacy – even in a world where much work remains to be done.
            In almost all countries, women continue to earn less than men. Discriminatory practices towards women are
            often justified by referring to traditional, historical, religious and cultural attitudes. Girls are less
            likely than boys to go to school or stay in school. Women often find their mobility limited because of
            expectations that they will be care-givers. They often have limited choices in whom to marry – or whether to
            marry at all – and little control over their reproductive choices.

            Despite all that remains to be achieved, the pioneering women who were part of the drafting process from
            1946 to 1948 enshrined equality as a universal goal and provided a foundation in international law for those
            who still struggle to make equality a reality. Not only women, of course, but also people with disabilities,
            elderly workers, members of ethnic and religious minorities, indigenous groups, migrants, children and
            anyone anywhere facing discrimination.

            <h1>Article 2: Freedom from Discrimination
            </h1>

            Article 2 states that everyone is entitled to all the freedoms listed in the UDHR, “without distinction of
            any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
            origin, property, birth or other status.” The last words of this sentence – “other status” – have frequently
            been cited to expand the list of people specifically protected.

            This language is reflected in regional instruments, such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples'
            Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human
            Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The UN has elaborated rights in a number of treaties that build on Article
            2 – including most recently the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in
            2006. It is also key to current efforts to protect all groups that face persecution, even those not
            specifically covered by a particular international Convention.

            In socially conservative Indian society, IT engineer Akhilesh Godi felt he barely existed. Depressed and
            wrestling with questions about his sexuality, he was afraid to seek help because he thought even a therapist
            would label him a criminal under India’s laws against homosexuality. Other homosexuals and transgender
            people in India said they faced severe discrimination or blackmail because of a 157-year-old ban on gay sex.

            Godi decided to push back. He was one of 20 openly gay students and alumni of various technology schools –
            including two women and a transgender woman – who won a ruling from India’s Supreme Court in September 2018
            striking down the colonial-era law. The justices did not simply decriminalize gay sex. They ruled that from
            now on gay Indians are to be accorded all the protections of the Constitution. The decision was welcomed by
            the UN, which said "sexual orientation and gender expression form an integral part of an individual's
            identity the world over.”

            When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was drafted 70 years ago, there may not have been many
            who agreed. But Article 2’s prohibition on discrimination – and its more positive assertion that human
            rights belong to everyone – has been the foundation for spelling out rights on age, disability and other
            subjects that were not issues in 1948.

            At that time, Chilean delegate Hernan Santa Cruz reminded his colleagues that Article 2 importantly
            amplified the basic provisions of the UN Charter, and commented that “the United Nations had been founded
            principally to combat discrimination in the world.” The Communist bloc pushed heavily from the start for
            clear language against discrimination.

            The Declaration’s first three articles are closely intertwined. Peng-chung Chang, a Chinese drafter with a
            remarkable knowledge of Eastern and Western philosophy, proposed that the first three Articles should
            reflect the main ideas of 18th century political philosophy on rights: “fraternity” (Article 1), “equality”
            (Article 2) and “liberty” (Article 3). Articles 1 and 2 set the tone for the entire Declaration with their
            prohibitions on discrimination.

            Both Articles continue to impact on new and evolving international standards. In 2006, former UN High
            Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour noted how the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
            Disabilities emphasized that “the celebration of diversity and empowerment of the individual are essential
            human rights messages,” adding that it envisages “a fully active role in society for persons with
            disabilities.”

            This Convention was drafted with the participation of people with disabilities, moving away from an older
            model of having internal law made for people or about them.

            Although protection grounded in the UDHR and guaranteed in other human rights treaties should apply to all,
            people with disabilities still can be invisible – unable to enjoy the full range of human rights.

            A disproportionate number of persons with disabilities live in developing countries, often marginalized and
            in extreme poverty, a fact this Convention aims to change, to ensure that people with disabilities de-facto
            enjoy the same rights and dignity as everyone else.

            This rights-based approach has also been taken up by indigenous peoples and those trying to end
            discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The UN itself is promoting respect for
            rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people of all ages and in all regions of the world.

            It is not necessary to create a new set of LGBT-specific rights, or set new international human rights
            standards. All that is required to protect LGBT people from violence and discrimination is respect for
            existing rights.

            There are 71 countries and territories, mainly in Africa, the Middle East and parts of south Asia, where
            consensual same-sex relationships are still criminalized, including eight where homosexuality could result
            in the death penalty.

            Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has admitted that sexual orientation and gender identity are
            understandably sensitive issues to some. “Like many of my generation, I did not grow up talking about these
            issues,” he told the Human Rights Council in 2012. “But I learned to speak out because lives are at stake,
            and because it is our duty under the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to
            protect the rights of everyone, everywhere.”

            <h1>Article 3: Right to Life</h1>

            The first six words of this short article are at the heart of global attempts to end the death penalty. If
            it enshrines the right to life, abolitionists argue, how can state-sponsored killing be justified? As South
            African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu said, “to take a life when a life has been lost is revenge, not
            justice.”

            Drafters of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) had fresh in their minds Nazi
            concentration camps and state-organized slaughter of millions simply because they were not the “correct”
            sort of person. Article 3 – and closely related Articles 5 and 9 against torture and arbitrary arrest – were
            a firm renunciation of Hitler’s belief in the supremacy of the state to control the lives of individuals.

            Chilean drafter Hernan Santa Cruz explained that many of the UDHR’s Articles, are based on the belief that
            "the interests of the individual [come] before those of the state and that the state should not be allowed
            to deprive the individual of his dignity and his basic rights.”

            The right to life has gone on to be one of the core rights accepted by countries; 77 percent of the world’s
            constitutions include this right, compared to 27 percent of constitutions in effect in 1945, when the UN was
            founded.

            Article 3 is about much more than the death penalty. It is fundamental to enjoyment of all other rights:
            after all, you have to be alive to exercise free speech, get married, or hold nationality.

            This was emphasized in a quasi-legal “general comment” document published in October 2018 by the Human
            Rights Committee, a body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the International Covenant
            on Civil and Political Rights, one of the two covenants that expand on the UDHR.

            It noted that the obligation to protect, respect and ensure the right to life covers many other issues
            including modern technologies such as the use of drones in armed conflict. Looking to the future, it said
            environmental degradation, climate change and unsustainable development represent serious threats to the
            ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life.

            Others have argued that Article 3 embraces many other issues – deprivation of health care that leads to
            death, extra-judicial killings, even the use of live ammunition by police forces against unarmed protestors.

            Antônio Cançado Trinidade, then President of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights wrote that “the
            arbitrary deprivation of life is not limited to the illicit act of homicide; it extends itself to the
            deprivation of the right to live with dignity.”

            The right to life is amplified in four UN treaties whose stated purpose is to abolish the death penalty, and
            since 2007 the UN General Assembly has adopted five non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium
            on executions as a step to eventual abolition. “There is no place for the death penalty in the 21st
            century,” said former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

            At least 39 executions have been carried out in the United States in face of compelling evidence of
            innocence or serious doubt about guilt.
            - Center on Wrongful Convictions Northwestern University School of Law

            When the UDHR was adopted on 10 December 1948, only 14 countries had abolished the death penalty. Seventy
            years on, more than two-thirds of UN member states have either abolished it or no longer actually apply it.
            Even in countries that have a mandatory death penalty, it is not always enforced by executions. At the end
            of March 2016, for example, the deputy prime minister of Malaysia announced that 829 persons had been
            sentenced to death between 2010 and March 2016 but only 12 executions had taken place during this time.

            Most nations that have abolished the use of the death penalty have cited human rights as a main motivator,
            while the steadily dwindling number of nations that retain the death penalty (88) or actually execute people
            (39), avoid framing capital punishment as a human rights issue.

            Threats to life, however, come not only from state executioners, but sometimes from your neighbor or your
            partner, from criminal gangs and armed groups, and States have an obligation to protect their citizens.

            Killings of women and girls – by their partners, by strangers, by parents who prefer boys – also constitute
            a particular grave and all-too-common abuse of this fundamental right, and females of all ages still often
            suffer inadequate legal and physical protection by state authorities and institutions. As Rashida Manjoo,
            former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women put it: “Women subjected to continuous violence are
            always on ‘death row,’ always in fear of execution.”

            <h1>Article 4: Freedom from Slavery</h1>

            Men bought and sold like commodities, held for years against their will on fishing boats off Thailand.
            Yazidi women sold into sex slavery, raped daily and passed from owner to owner. Human beings offered as
            birthday gifts to children.

            Article 4 is clear: no one has the right to make us a slave and we cannot make anyone our slave. But if you
            thought slavery disappeared with the end of the Transatlantic slave trade in the 1800s, it may be a shock to
            learn of the abuse of fisherfolk who supply seafood to some of the world’s top supermarkets, the fate of
            women under so-called Islamic State or of migrant women in brothels in Europe and elsewhere; or current
            reality in Mauritania, the last country in the world to officially ban slavery.

            Enormous progress has been made in the 70 years since adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
            (UDHR) and indeed in the 150 years since entire economies were based on ownership of our fellow human
            beings, and religious leaders found divine inspiration for the oppressive system. Yet, slavery-like
            practices and trafficking in human beings continue to remain a reality of our time.

            In the words of British investigative journalist Ross Kemp, “There are more slaves today than there were at
            the height of the slave trade.”

            Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 (jointly with Congolese gynaecologist
            Denis Mukwege) for publicizing rape as a weapon of war, called her autobiography ‘The Last Girl’ because “I
            want to be the last girl in the world with a story like mine.” She was captured by ISIS in Iraq at the age
            of 21 and sold into sexual slavery, targeted because her family belonged to the minority Yazidi religion.

            Fully wiping out slavery – some two centuries after Denmark and France led efforts to outlaw it – is still a
            struggle. As recently as 2016, an estimated 40.3 million people were living in modern slavery, and 70
            percent of them were women and girls. Persecution and migration have propelled many desperate people,
            unwittingly, into the hands of human traffickers. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO),
            in the past five years 89 million people experienced some contemporary form of slavery for periods ranging
            from a few days to five years.

            “For us, slavery was really a natural state. When one is born into a certain environment, it is considered
            the right one – just and fair.”
            - Abdel Nasser Ould Ethmane, Mauritanian who received a slave for his 7th birthday and later became an
            anti-slavery campaigner.

            The trafficking of people is truly global in nature, with victims of some 160 different citizenships
            detected in or repatriated from some 140 different countries, according to a report produced by the UN
            Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which described this data as “only the tip of the iceberg.” However,
            while many victims from sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia in particular end up on different continents, the
            majority of people who are trafficked remain in their home countries or regions.

            The West African country of Mauritania – where certain people of sub-Saharan African origin have often been
            enslaved as domestic workers by groups with different racial and ethnic origins – became the last country in
            the world to abolish slavery in 1981. However, it was not until 2007 that criminal laws were passed to
            enforce the ban. Campaigners say the country has jailed more anti-slavery activists than slave owners.

            Elsewhere, cold hard cash is generally the reason slavery flourishes. Investigations by journalists,
            non-governmental organizations and the UN in 2014 and 2015 found that much of Thailand’s $7-billion fishing
            industry was based on kidnapping, violence and imprisonment. Poor men from southeast Asia were lured with
            promises of good jobs, but found instead 20-hour-shifts fuelled by methamphetamines, regular beatings,
            torture and execution-style killings. Many were freed thanks to the investigations.

            According to the ILO, the 60-75 million people working in the garment industry around the world – some 75
            percent of whom are women and girls -- are particularly prone to exploitation and abuse. Research into the
            industry in various countries has revealed widespread deception over wages and working conditions,
            restrictions on workers’ movement, intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive working and
            living conditions.

            An estimated 92 percent of those engaged in forced labour in the accommodation and food services sector are
            women and girls, and the ILO estimates that 24 percent of all domestic workers – of whom the great majority
            are also women – are subjected to forced labour.

            “Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.”
            - President Abraham Lincoln, who freed slaves in the United States.

            Domestic workers are one of the groups most vulnerable to what is perhaps the least known form of modern-day
            slavery, known as ‘debt bondage’, where a person is forced to work to pay off a debt – which grows steadily,
            and which they can never actually discharge. It still flourishes in the brick kilns, mills, mines and
            factories of South Asia, as well as in other parts of the globe. It is also rampant in the agricultural
            sector, where a number of cases involving migrant workers have recently come to light in various European
            countries where it is also frequently used by traffickers to ensnare women and girls into prostitution. Many
            argue that the ‘kafala’ system operating in a number of Gulf States – where employers have complete control
            over their domestic workers – is also a form of slavery. Social media in Saudi Arabia, for example, has
            featured posts by people offering domestic workers “for sale.”

            Armed with Article 4 of the UDHR (and the legally binding International Covenant on Civil and Political
            Rights, which flows from it), abolitionists continue the fight. Contemporary forms of slavery – whether
            bonded labour, involuntary servitude, or sexual slavery – are crimes and should no longer be tolerated
            anywhere in any form, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged everyone to “come together around
            the key issues of prevention, protection and prosecution to build a future where this crime cannot exist.”

            <h1>Article 5: Freedom from Torture</h1>

            There is one absolute prohibition in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) that is universally
            accepted as unequivocal: Article 5’s ban on torture. At times, states may have disputed the definition of
            what constitutes torture, but virtually none now openly defend the practice, even if some still carry it out
            in what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described as “some of the darkest corners of our planet.”

            The ban on torture is another reflection of the revulsion against Nazi concentration camps and Nazi medical
            experiments on living people that so motivated the drafters of the UDHR in the late 1940s. It is further
            elaborated in the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture, which makes the absolute nature of the prohibition of
            torture crystal clear: “No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war,
            internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as justification of torture.”

            Given this universal abhorrence, why would any contemporary democratic society condone the use of torture?
            The case most often made for torture is that – particularly in the fight against terrorism – it can save
            lives of innocent people..

            Aside from all the flaws in the imaginary “ticking bomb” argument (How do security forces know they have the
            right person? How do they know the suspect won’t make things up simply to relieve the pain?) most reject it
            as merely an excuse for dehumanizing behaviour designed to assert power.

            The ban on torture is so absolute that the UN body charged with monitoring the prevention of torture has
            recommended even trainee soldiers should be reminded that they have a duty to disobey orders from a superior
            officer to commit torture. The fact that some states have gone to such lengths to redefine some of their
            practices, some argue, shows that they actually respect the universal prohibition on torture, even as they
            try to subvert it.

            Following the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the administration of President George W.
            Bush reinterpreted the word “torture” very narrowly in an effort to give officials leeway to mistreat
            suspects. Memos later made public showed the administration believed the prohibitions against torture were
            “quaint” and “obsolete,” did not apply in what it labelled the “war on terrorism,” and even that the
            President could “override” international law.

            New euphemisms were invented to cover the administration’s actions. Under “extraordinary rendition” the U.S.
            whisked suspects off to “black sites” – detention centres in Abu Ghraib in Iraq, Bagram Prison in
            Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba – to be subjected to “enhanced interrogation techniques.”

            These shocking practices were condemned by a long list of organizations and people, including a number of
            retired generals, admirals, military lawyers and intelligence officers. But any discussion of human rights
            tended to be submerged under more ‘practical’ discussions – irrelevant under international law – of whether
            torture was an effective and reliable means of extracting useful information.

            Finally, it was the ubiquitous digital camera rather than moral arguments that turned the tide against
            “defining away” torture. Photos of naked Iraqi prisoners being humiliated while U.S. soldiers grinned
            proudly into the camera became emblematic of official human rights abuses. The U.S. later repudiated these
            practices.

            Today activists around the world risk their lives to document abuses and disseminate evidence quickly on
            social media. But what is done with the information depends on political will. “The problem is not lack of
            early warning,” says Pierre Sané of Senegal, former head of Amnesty International, “but lack of early
            action.”

            Even so, the UN considers that regular monitoring of places of detention by internal and external
            independent oversight mechanisms to be one of the most effective methods of preventing torture. The
            elevation of human rights to the international level means that behaviour is no longer governed solely by
            national standards. International and regional treaties against torture (as well as against genocide and
            enforced disappearances) have overcome arguments that certain individuals enjoy international immunity from
            prosecution. Under the principle known as ‘universal jurisdiction’ people suspected of the most serious
            international crimes – including torture – may be arrested, tried and convicted in countries other than
            their own.

            As one former UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay put it, “no one is let off the hook – neither the actual
            torturers themselves, nor the policy-makers and public officials who define the policy or give the orders.”

            As just one example, “Chuckie” Taylor, son of the former president of Liberia, is in prison in Florida in
            the United States, serving a 97-year sentence for torture and other human rights violations committed on his
            home soil.

            When former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet died in 2006, he had spent a year and a half under house
            arrest in London, and upon his return to Chile was charged with several of the more than 300 crimes in which
            he had been implicated in relation to human rights violations during the military dictatorship from
            1973-1990. Although held under house arrest, he had not yet been tried or convicted by the time he died.

            In 1975, a young woman was arrested by Pinochet’s political police and interrogated at the infamous Villa
            Grimaldi torture centre in Chile’s capital, Santiago. Decades later, after democracy was restored, Michelle
            Bachelet went on to serve two terms as president of Chile. Today she is the UN High Commissioner for Human
            Rights.

            <h1>Article 6: Right to Recognition Before the Law</h1>


            After setting standards for dignity and freedom, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) devotes a
            cluster of articles to standards for the administration of justice including what is often known as “due
            process.” Roughly one-fourth of the UDHR is devoted to legal human rights. As we have already seen, in the
            late 1940s, the abuses of the Nazi regime were fresh in the mind of the UDHR’s drafters, who thought these
            provisions would entrench the strongest protection against future Nazi-type human rights violations. And
            indeed, by the late 1940s all of these provisions had been incorporated in the legal systems of developed
            nations.

            Articles 6-11 are closely related and for the most part focus on some of the civil and political rights all
            humans should expect, with the second half of the UDHR devoted to social, economic and cultural rights.
            Article 6 itself, however, applies across the entire spectrum of rights. If an individual is not recognized
            “as a person under the law,” numerous rights, including ones in the social and economic spheres, may be
            threatened.

            Article 6 has come into sharp focus with the phenomenon of enforced or involuntary disappearances – the
            practice of certain countries of snatching, detaining -- and likely killing -- people, with their families
            seldom able to find out their fate.

            People like The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Asociación Madres de Plaza de Mayo) who protested for years
            against the enforced disappearance of their children during Argentina’s “Dirty War” between 1976 and 1983.
            Wearing white scarves to symbolize the diapers of their children, the women defied the military dictatorship
            to demonstrate in front of the presidential palace to try to get information about their missing children.

            “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
            - Martin Luther King, African-American civil rights activist

            During the period of military rule in Argentina, security forces ‘forcibly disappeared’ – the technical term
            when a kidnapping is carried out by the state – around 30,000 people, many of whom are still unaccounted
            for. The long list of the disappeared even included two of the founders of the Mothers of the Plaza. Similar
            policies of enforced disappearance were pursued in several other Latin American countries run by military
            dictators, such as Chile, Guatemala and Peru.

            However, Latin American generals did not invent the concept. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s,
            more than 143,000 people disappeared without a trace.

            And the first instance of enforced disappearance being explicitly and unashamedly sanctioned by law occurred
            when Hitler issued the directive ‘Nacht und Nebel’ (‘Night and Fog’) in December 1941, in order to secretly
            transfer thousands of people to Germany from the occupied parts of Europe, many of whom were presumably
            later killed. The measure targeted the civilian population, with the aimed of deterring all forms of
            resistance. The uncertainty of the fate of the disappeared – removed from all the normal legal protections
            and processes they should have enjoyed after being picked up in the dead of night – was deliberately
            designed to terrorize and paralyze society as a whole. They were, to use a term employed by the Nazis,
            “transformed into mist.”

            Regional bodies – such as the European Court of Human Rights, which protects the rights of some 800 million
            people – have played an important part in recent years in providing remedies for victims of this crime, and
            deterring States from committing it.

            However, enforced disappearance is a global problem, not restricted to a specific region, with the UN
            Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances reviewing some 840 cases from 46 countries in
            September 2018. Amnesty International has identified Syria and Sri Lanka as two of the worst countries for
            enforced disappearance. Russia and the U.S. (with its rendition programme during the “War on Terror”) have
            also been accused of committing this violation.

            But the problem is not necessarily confined to government security forces, with disappearances at the hands
            of criminal gangs, often entwined with the authorities at some level, becoming a chronic problem in recent
            years in Central American countries and Mexico, as well as in countries like Iraq. Human rights defenders
            and environmental defenders have become particular targets, both in Latin America and in some countries in
            South-East Asia, often while standing up for the rights of local populations against business and economic
            interests.

            Failure to achieve recognition before the law as required by Article 6 is, of course, much broader than the
            issue of enforced disappearance. In some countries women still do not have the same rights under the law as
            men. For example, there are some 32 countries where women need their husband’s permission to apply for a
            passport, and 30 where women cannot choose where to live.

            And perhaps the biggest issue facing the world’s 3.9 million known stateless people, is that they are
            excluded from some – or even all -- laws and systems designed to protect a country’s citizens. This legal
            limbo can have a devastating impact not just on stateless people themselves: their children and
            grandchildren may inherit their statelessness, like some abstract genetic disease, as their births cannot be
            registered, because their parents do not exist in the eyes of the law.

            As a result they may suffer violations of almost the entire range of social, political, economic and civil
            rights: unable to vote, marry, get an education, bring a court case, or receive medical care. While some
            people become stateless as an unforeseen consequence of a change or flaw in domestic legislation, a sizeable
            minority are, in the words of the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, “the victims of a more pernicious form of
            statelessness: the deliberate exclusion of entire groups because of some political, religious or ethnic
            discrimination.” The most egregious current example of this is the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, who are
            deprived of many of their rights because they are denied citizenship.

            Many still share the dream of physicist Albert Einstein, who said in 1933, as his homeland Germany began to
            sink into fascism: “As long as I have any choice, I will only stay in a country where political liberty,
            toleration and equality of all citizens before the law are the rule.” But in an age when refugees are
            finding more and more obstacles being placed in the way of their legal right to seek asylum from
            persecution, Einstein’s dream – and the pathway to it laid down in the UDHR -- is still unattainable for
            many.

            <h1>Article 7: Right to Equality Before the Law</h1>


            At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, women in many industrialized countries
            fought for the right to vote. “There never will be complete equality until women themselves help to make
            laws and elect lawmakers,” said U.S. suffragette Susan B. Anthony.

            More than a century on, the only country in the world where women cannot vote is Vatican City: there the
            right to cast ballots for a new Pope is restricted to cardinals, who are all men. But, as the UN High
            Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out in 2107, despite universal gains at the ballot box, “many women
            and girls continue to be routinely deprived of equal access to resources, denied choice, robbed of
            opportunities and constrained by false and humiliating stereotypes.”

            Article 7 says the law is the same for everyone, and must treat everyone in all these categories fairly.
            Three times within 39 words, it bans discrimination. These principles of equality and non-discrimination
            help form the rule of law. These obligations are further elaborated in a number of international instruments
            to combat specific forms of discrimination against not only women, but also indigenous peoples, migrants,
            minorities, people with disabilities. Discrimination on grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation and
            gender identity are also covered.

            A succession of international human rights treaties have amplified the rights listed in Article 7, and over
            the decades, jurisprudence has added further obligations to the ban on discrimination. It is not enough for
            countries to refrain from treating certain groups unfavourably. They now have to take positive steps to
            redress discrimination. For example, under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,
            countries must support persons with disabilities to enable them to make legal decisions by themselves,
            rather than deny them their legal capacity.

            “Gender equality is more than a goal in itself. It is a precondition for meeting the challenge of reducing
            poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance.”
            – Kofi Annan, late UN Secretary General

            Countries may also need to adopt temporary special measures to overcome past or present discrimination, and
            accelerate the establishment of real equality – and some have taken very effective measures with regard to
            specific groups. In the 2018 Rwanda elections, 61% of seats in parliament went to women. The steady increase
            in the number of women Members of Parliament is a direct result of Rwanda’s 2003 Constitution which set a 30
            percent quota for women in elected positions, and the decision by political parties to voluntarily adopt
            their own quotas for women candidates.

            The principle of equality for all does not only apply to governments. Discrimination must also be addressed
            in the workplace, school and home.

            Indisputably, women in most parts of the world have made tremendous progress in achieving equality before
            the law since the days of the suffragettes, and since the UDHR was adopted in 1948. Yet in 2018, according
            to the World Bank, 104 countries still have laws preventing women from working in specific jobs, 59 have no
            laws on sexual harassment in the workplace, and in 18 countries, husbands can legally prevent their wives
            from working.

            Many laws around the world do little to deter violence against women and in some cases, even encourage it or
            condone it. This is, for example, the case in countries where rapists are allowed by law to escape
            prosecution if they marry the victim.

            Even if laws are not discriminatory on paper, their application can be discriminatory in practice. The UN
            Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has called for the repeal of
            discriminatory evidentiary rules and procedures, including procedures that allow women to be deprived of
            their liberty to “protect” them from violence; conducting ‘virginity tests’; and the use, as a legal defence
            or mitigating factor, of arguments based on culture, religion or male privilege, such as the so-called
            ‘defence of honour.’ CEDAW has also called for an end to procedures that reserve extraordinarily harsh
            penalties – including stoning, lashing and death – for women; as well as judicial practices that ignore a
            history of gender-based violence when dealing with women defendants.

            Discrimination against women is often intertwined with discrimination on other grounds, such as race,
            colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other
            status. In Latin America, poverty rates are high for women, but even higher for women of African descent. In
            the U.S., 37 percent of households headed by African-American woman live below the poverty line. And First
            Nations Canadian and Afro-Canadian women and girls have inferior educational opportunities compared to other
            Canadians, including men and boys from their own group.

            Women and girls are, of course, not the only people in the world who sometimes find themselves deprived of
            equality before the law. In some countries, discrimination against certain religions or minorities is
            official policy – or even law. An annual report by the independent World Justice Project showed that in
            2017-2018, 71 countries out of 113 surveyed actually slipped back in their efforts to combat discrimination.

            UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has noted the considerable progress made in the 70
            years since the UDHR was adopted, as a result of people across the world demanding “an end to
            discrimination, tyranny and exploitation.” However, there is no question that the world still has a long way
            to go if it wants to accomplish the pledge made by former South African president Nelson Mandela – a victim
            of the flagrantly racist laws and regulations of the apartheid system – “to liberate all our people from the
            continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.”

            <h1>Article 8: Right to Remedy</h1>


            The pledge of effective remedy for everyone, found in Article 8, is an intrinsic – if all too often
            neglected – part of the system of providing justice. “True peace is not merely the absence of war, it is the
            presence of justice,” said Jane Addams, the second woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, said in 1931.

            After two World Wars, the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) considered it
            important to assert the principle of free treatment by fair courts – that all of us have an avenue for
            redress if our rights are violated. “Societies based on justice and equal rights before the law are not just
            more fair – they are more cohesive,” said Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, former UN High Commissioner for Human
            Rights. Economic evidence shows they are also more prosperous, he added.

            Justice is not just about crime and punishment. Fair trials and due process are also vital components of any
            system of justice, but as defined in the UDHR, justice is a holistic concept which also includes providing
            effective remedies for injustice and violations of the rights of all individuals “as granted… by the
            constitution or by law” – and not necessarily simply financial compensation. As the old saying goes, money
            does not buy forgiveness, nor does it solve all woes.

            Over the years, states have applied a wide variety of different remedies – either in response to domestic
            courts or to other entities, including regional and international courts and institutions, as well as UN
            bodies – and they have covered violations across the whole spectrum of civil, political, economic, social
            and cultural rights.

            Some remedies are compensatory in character; some are restorative – designed to put the victim back in the
            position they would have been had no wrongful act been committed; and others are designed to prevent the
            repetition of the violation in question. In addition to money, remedies may include measures such as early
            release from prison, legislative change, provision of residence permits, reinstatement in public service
            employment, assistance with finding jobs, or provision of housing.

            When the victim is dead, the remedy may involve a matter as simple as ordering of a death certificate
            enabling his or her family to inherit property, or official acknowledgement of a grave. It might involve the
            erection of a monument, or the naming of a square after a victim. Or it might take the form of a public oral
            and written apology for the wrong done, such as the 2008 National Apology by the Australian government to
            the ‘Stolen Generations’ – the descendants of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who were
            forcibly removed from their families by the Australian authorities over a 60-year period up to 1970.

            “Nothing is settled permanently that is not settled right.”
            – Anonymous proverb

            Such remedies can have immense emotional force for the families and people whose ancestors’ rights were
            violated. Another example of this is the truth-telling and reparations provided to survivors of the
            “Magdalene Laundries”, the Irish work-houses where, from 1922 to 1996, some 10,000 women and girls were made
            to work without pay in laundries run by Roman Catholic nuns. Performing a similar function, numerous Truth
            and Reconciliation Commissions have been set up to address gross human rights violations in many countries,
            most notably in Latin America, but also, for example, in South Africa and Kenya.

            Other remedies may involve practical measures such as changing hospital procedures to better protect
            patients, or providing psychological support for someone suffering from post-traumatic stress. It may
            stretch as wide as the reform of the family justice system, or be as specific as a ban on corporal
            punishment.
            While many people – especially the poor and the marginalized – receive neither justice nor remedy, when the
            system works in accordance with Article 8 (subsequently fleshed out in other international treaties) remedy
            is provided -- sometimes quite comprehensively.

            In July 2011, reacting to a complaint from a 15-year-old indigenous girl in Argentina who had been a victim
            of rape by non-indigenous men and of discrimination based on gender and ethnicity, the UN’s Human Rights
            Committee, based in Geneva, found numerous and wide-ranging violations of the girl’s rights, including her
            appalling treatment at the hands of all the authorities involved: kept waiting for hours in her blood-soaked
            clothes in a police station; subjected to offensive remarks about her sexual history, to demonstrate her
            ‘consent’, and accused of being a prostitute. The Argentinian authorities responded by awarding the girl US$
            53,000 in compensation and a life-long monthly stipend. She was also given a property and a scholarship. In
            addition, as a means of rounding off the remedy, all the judicial officials in her home province were made
            to undergo compulsory training on gender discrimination and violence against women.

            In deportation cases, where there is a clear risk of torture or grave human rights violations in the country
            of return, many states adhere to the legal principle of “non-refoulement” and avoid deporting the
            individuals concerned. In one such case where an individual was expelled to Egypt where he was subsequently
            tortured, Sweden ensured his release and return to Sweden, where he was granted a permanent residence permit
            in July 2012 and compensation amounting to some US$ 350,000.

            In many cases, no remedy, however generous and well-considered, will completely erase the stain of the
            original violation of the victim’s rights. But remedies are an important way to ease the pain and provide
            the means for the man, woman or child concerned to look to the future rather than remained enslaved to a
            dark and damaging past injustice that was imposed upon them.

            <h1> Article 9: Freedom from Arbitrary Detention</h1>


            Can you get locked up for being a poet? Yes, in the Soviet Union in 1964. Joseph Brodsky, now considered one
            of Russia’s greatest poets, was hauled into court in Leningrad, accused of being “a pseudo-poet in velveteen
            trousers” – specifically a freeloader who contributed nothing to society. Soviet judges simply could not see
            the value of poetry. Despite having no actual mental illness, Brodsky was sent off for two stints in
            psychiatric prisons where he was effectively tortured – one of thousands to suffer such a fate in the Soviet
            Union.

            The abuse of psychiatry to keep dissenters in line is one of several violations covered under Article 9 of
            the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which basically says no one can be put in prison and kept there
            without a good reason. It applies not only to prisons, but also to an increasing number of places where
            people might be held without a fair trial or clear sentence: asylum detention centres, immigration
            facilities and drug treatment centres.

            The use of “political psychiatry” – defining opposition as an ailment and confining dissidents in
            psychiatric hospitals – temporarily disappeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, a
            small number of countries have been accused of still abusing psychiatry to control their citizens.

            Freedom from arbitrary detention is closely related to other sections of the Universal Declaration of Human
            Rights (UDHR): Article 3’s right to life and Article 5’s ban on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading
            treatment or punishment. Although the UDHR never uses the term habeas corpus (Medieval Latin for “you have
            the body”), the ban on arbitrary detention also harkens back to the centuries-old right of every inmate to
            be brought to court so it can be determined whether they are unlawfully imprisoned and should be released.

            The right to personal liberty under the UDHR is not unlimited, but detention must be in accordance with
            national and international law. Authorities should only detain people following clear, public procedures. To
            avoid being classified as arbitrary, detention must be appropriate, predictable, proportionate, necessary –
            and based on justice. Thus, countries can deprive people of liberty – within certain limits – while they
            await trial, and after conviction and sentencing, among other situations.

            Detention is considered arbitrary if there was no fair trial, or there is no legal basis for it, as when a
            person is kept in custody after serving their sentence. Significantly, no one should be locked up simply for
            exercising a number of rights covered by the UDHR, such as freedom of expression (Article 19), freedom of
            religion (Article 18), or the right to claim asylum (Article 14).

            “The right to personal liberty is fundamental and extends to all persons at all times and circumstances,
            including migrants and asylum seekers irrespective of their citizenship, nationality or migratory status.”
            -- UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, February, 2018

            The United States has been accused of arbitrary detention in its so-called “War on Terror,” particularly at
            its Guantánamo Bay military prison in Cuba, and other sites around the world. More recently, the UN Working
            Group on Arbitrary Detention has called on the U.S. to protect the rights of young migrants.

            Australia has repeatedly been criticized for routinely detaining asylum-seekers, including one stateless man
            who was held for nine years without charge or trial. In 2018, the Working Group took the extraordinary step
            of calling on Australia to review its domestic laws, and ruled it had breached a number of international
            human rights laws. One Iranian man, it said, has been held in detention simply for exercising the right to
            seek asylum.

            It’s not only immigration detention that is a concern. On a 2013 visit to Hungary, for example, the Working
            Group found that an unreasonable number of people were routinely held in detention for a year or longer
            before their trials on criminal charges. Pre-trial detention, it said, must be the exception and not the
            rule.

            With Article 9, part of the large section of the UDHR (Articles 6-11) devoted to standards for the
            administration of justice, the Universal Declaration makes clear that a person’s freedom does not
            automatically evaporate on arrest or conviction. The person still has rights in court or behind bars – and
            the right to hold arresting or imprisoning authorities to specific standards.

            <h1>Article 10: Right to a Fair Trial</h1>


            In the U.S. state of Maryland in 1984, an anonymous woman called police to identify a man shown in a police
            sketch of a suspect: Kirk Bloodsworth. The former Marine, then 22, was promptly arrested for the gruesome
            rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl. Despite thin and contradictory evidence presented at trial, he was
            convicted and sentenced to death.

            Constantly protesting his innocence, Bloodsworth was to become, in 1993, the first person in the United
            States freed from death row on the basis of DNA evidence proving innocence. He was released after more than
            nine years in prison, but not fully exonerated until 2003. Another man pleaded guilty to the crime in 2004.

            The right to a fair trial is at the heart of Article 10, one more section of the 1948 Universal Declaration
            of Human Rights (UDHR) that aims to prevent a repetition of the atrocities of Hitler’s Germany, where
            compliant judges and courts served the aims of the Nazi regime, rather than the cause of justice in the
            interest of the people. Some guarantees of a fair trial, including the right to presumption of innocence,
            can also be found in Articles 6, 7, 8 and 11 of the Declaration.

            The right to a fair trial has been accepted beyond dispute by every country (even if they do not always
            honour it). Fair trials not only protect suspects and defendants, they make societies safer and stronger by
            solidifying confidence in justice and the rule of law.

            But what is a fair trial?

            The hallmarks of a fair trial include: the right to be present in court; to have a speedy public trial
            before an independent and impartial court; and to have a lawyer of one’s choice, or one provided at no cost.
            Also fundamental is the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the right not to be compelled
            to testify against yourself. These are spelled out in greater detail in the International Covenant on Civil
            and Political Rights, a legally binding elaboration of some of the core principles covered in the UDHR.

            At one stage in Kirk Bloodsworth’s long fight to prove his innocence, an appeals court overturned his
            conviction because he had not benefitted from another requirement for a fair trial: the right to see
            evidence. In his case, evidence that pointed to another suspect. After his release, Bloodsworth helped win
            passage of a law that makes it easier for people in the U.S. to get DNA testing after a conviction – an
            example of a remedy designed to prevent the repetition of the violation (as described under Article 8 – the
            Right to Remedy).

            As his case shows, standards for what constitutes a fair trial are always being raised, not only in criminal
            cases, but in civil ones as well. The right to a fair trial is also enshrined in a number of regional human
            rights documents, such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the European Convention on Human
            Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights. Developing issues include the quality of transcripts,
            and the quality of translation in court proceedings.

            Issues surrounding the right to a fair trial occur in every country of the world to a greater or lesser
            degree. Many legal systems contain numerous safeguards to minimize miscarriages of justice – even if they do
            not always work perfectly – but in some countries such systems are not fully developed, are undermined by
            corruption or incompetence, or do not work in practice for a variety of other reasons.

            The issue is linked not just to the quality of legal safeguards – and the definition of a given crime – but
            also to the independence of judges, prosecutors and lawyers. This is fundamental: if the key players in the
            judicial system are subject to political control, or are too afraid to defend or acquit someone whom they
            know to be innocent of any real crime; or if what is a minor misdemeanour (or the expression of a particular
            opinion or other fundamental right protected under international law such as freedom of assembly or
            association) is punishable by a draconian jail sentence or even the death penalty – then the idea of a fair
            trial becomes illusory.

            There are sometimes attempts to politicize or control the judiciary in ways that could threaten suspects’
            rights to a fair trial, even in countries where the right is fairly well established. In 2018, the European
            Union’s highest tribunal, the European Court of Justice, ordered Poland’s government to suspend a law
            lowering Supreme Court retirement ages that would have obliged two-fifths of its judges to step down. It was
            widely interpreted as an effort by the government to fill the bench with its own people.

            Most worryingly, in a number of countries, the authorities actively work to undermine existing fair trial
            procedures in order to quash dissent and remove political opponents, or independent-minded journalists and
            human rights defenders. Recent developments in a number of countries suggest this problem may be becoming
            more acute, as more authoritarian governments attempt to consolidate power by locking up dissenters.

            In recent years, the UN Human Rights Office, and other UN human rights bodies and independent experts have
            expressed particular alarm about the situation linked to fair trials and independence of the judiciary in
            numerous countries including Bahrain, China, Egypt, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Iraq, the Maldives, Myanmar,
            Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkey, Venezuela and Vietnam – to name just a few.

            In Egypt and Iraq, the handing down of dozens of death sentences after a number of blatantly flawed trials
            has been strongly condemned by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

            In China, the lack of transparency surrounding trials and administration of justice, as well as the tendency
            to rely on “confessions” which may well have been coerced, have resulted in the jailing or disappearance of
            numerous human rights defenders and political activists, along with their defence lawyers, since a major
            crackdown on dissent began in July 2015. This apparent violation of the right to fair trial has been widely
            condemned, including by successive UN High Commissioners for Human Rights, and a wide range of UN
            independent experts.
